Quiz Game

In this project I created a simple JavaScript quiz game utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Media Queries, and JavaScript.
Hitting the start button begins the game and starts the timer, a countdown giving the user 75 seconds to complete the quiz.
And wrong answers will deduct 15 seconds from the timer.
The time remaining at the end is the user's score.
The user is then prompted to enter their initials, where it is then shown in a "high score list" that uses local storage to access.
The user than then go back and re-do the quiz or clear the high scores.

No additional software is needed.

Built with VSCode.
